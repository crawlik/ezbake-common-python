# EzBake Common Libraries for Python

This repo contains all of the core EzBake libraries for python. Essentially everything that is needed
to write an application for EzBake.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo

```
git clone <repo url> ezbake-common-python
cd ezbake-common-python
```

The layout of the directories follows a logical structure: configuration, discovery, thrift-utils, etc. Typically, each
sub directory is it's own python package.

### Dependencies
- Python 2.7.x
- pip

```
curl -sS --retry 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```
- setuptools (installed by pip)

Install the required development packages with pip

```
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

### Configuring pip for Artifactory

We use an Artifactory Pypi repo for EzBake. The __setup_artifactory_pypi.sh__ script can be used to configure pip and
setuptools. Just make sure to export user credentials first. Ex:

```
export ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL=my.artifactory.server.com/artifactory
export ARTIFACTORY_USER=my_user_name
export ARTIFACTORY_PASS=my_artifactory_password
```

Existing configurations are saved in .bak files before being overwritten.

### Installing packages

Each sub project contains a requirements.txt file that can be used in conjunction with pip to install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you find yourself needing to install an EzBake dependency, that can be installed with pip as well

```
pip install ezbake-configuration

# If installing a pre-release version, i.e. 2.1rc1
pip install --pre ezbake-configuration
```

### Publishing packages

__NOTE__: These steps are outlined for reference, and should only be performed by team leads. In the future publishing
to the pypi repo will be performed by Jenkins.

For daily builds:

```
python setup.py egg_info -b "$(date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S")" rotate -m .egg -k 5 sdist upload -r ezbake-local
```

For releases:

```
python setup.py sdist upload -r ezbake-local
```

## Deploying on EzBake

EzBake requires the use of pre-packaged wheels of all dependencies for deployment. This should be done
on a Centos 6.5 x86_64 environment.

### EzBake Common pre-reqs for building wheels

Due to some of the requirements of EzBake common python libraries, there are some system requirements
for building wheels

- openssl-devel
- libffi-devel
