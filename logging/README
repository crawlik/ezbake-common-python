# EzBake Logging

The EzBake Logging library can be used to help configure the root logger to log in a way compatible with EzBake logging.
One of the things this provides is a logging pattern that is compatible with the EzBake logstash parsers. In addition,
when using the EzBake logging configuration, log file rotation is guaranteed.

## Example usage

```py
from ezbake.configuration.EzConfiguration import EzConfiguration
from ezbake import ezlogging

# Setup logging with ezbake
ezlogging.ezConfig()

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.debug("log message")
```
